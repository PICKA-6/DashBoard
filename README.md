# DashBoard

This project is a highly responsive web application built using React.js and TypeScript. The UI is created using Chakra UI, a popular React component library that provides a set of accessible and customizable UI components. The dashboard charts are implemented using Nivo Charts, a third-party charting library that offers a wide range of data visualization tools.
